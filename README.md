# Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy with PHP.

# Why?

My school gives to the students access to a server.

We can serve static files and PHP it's also supported. That is why this is in
PHP.

Let's say I created an HTTP server at localhost port 3000 (with PHP, node.js,
...). I can't make people able to access it over the internet because I don't
have privileges to change the Apache server config or whatever to create a
reverse proxy.

I'm trying to use the tools that were given to me :)
